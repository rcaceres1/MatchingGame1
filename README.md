### Name of Game: Lucy's Matching Game! _(named after my late grandmother, Lucia Palacios)_

#### Background of Game: 

The game is a matching cards game. It's the perfect type of game for the students who 
have low-incidence disabilities and cortical visual impairment (CVI). Students with CVI 
and multiple disabilities need high contrast pictures on a black background (screenshots below).  

#### Screenshots: [Check them out!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19l7PTf0PlTPB_83qDeAdS42-fYin4YePjDz8moMD6fk/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Rules and Features
_I will be demonstrating a combination of Level 2 and Level 3 (Shown in the Next Steps section_

1. Player will have to match a base card with a matching card that is outside of the space
where said matching card belongs. When they click on the correct card, a message appears that they found the match. If they click on the wrong card, a message will display to try again. When they 'click', a motivating sound will play, then move to the next set. 

2. For the purposes of this game, there are ten cards for the player to match. The choice cards will be displayed on the bottom, and the matching card changes location randomly as the player continues throughout the game.  

**Reset Button:** The reset button on the screen is available so that board can be rendered again.



#### Next Steps: 

As I continue to develop the game, I would like to incorporate the following levels: 

**-Level 1:** matching the base card with a card that is the same image, and you need to click 
on the card for it to move next to the base card. You do that 10 times, and then you move 
up to the next level. 


**-Level two:** a base card, then two cards, with one that is a match for the base card. 
Do that ten times, then move to the next level. to choose that match the main card.  You would 
alternate between two different main cards. Do that 10 times, then move to the next level.


**-Level 3:** Random cards with two card choices for the kids to pick. 

**Possible level 4:** Two main cards and 3 cards to choose from...it could grow into 
a complicated game based on the child's ability. 

**-Other Enhancements:** Animations and sounds every time the child gets it right to 
keep them motivated, as this population needs constant, consistent positive reinforcement.
